# Terminal Python Logger

I wrote this to keep track of time spent on a project in school. It is very rudimentary, but it has some interesting features. Here is the current todo list:

* Package this so as to avoid typing so many characters. 

* Implement different catagories of spending time better. 

* Fix the plotting.

If you have any requests, feel free to tell me!
